# Regex Tutorial - Matching a Email

Regular expression or regex for short, is a combination of a text string that enables the creation of patterns to match, find, and manage text. Regex can be used for alot of things, such as validating a user input for a form, like signing up or matching a certain requirement on a password, and so much more. For the most part, regex is commonly used more in validating a user input. Whether is email, name, phone number, username, they are can be validated with using regex. Once you understand the symbols and the patterns in regex, then it will be lot easier for you to create your own regex that matches your requirements.

## Summary

In this regex tutorial, I will be explaining how to use regular expression to match an email.
The example regex pattern I will be explaining will be

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. 
```

This regex expression is one way to match a email, but there other many different ways a person can match an email in regex, but for this example, we will use the one that is listed above. In this tutorial, I will break down each part and each symbol of the regex above and describing what it does.
