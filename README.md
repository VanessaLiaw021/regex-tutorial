## Description 

This is a tutorial on how to explain each component of the regex example in the matching-an-email-regex.md. In this tutorial, I will be explaining and breakdown each component with the regex example below:

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This example is an example of matching an email validation. This tutorial will explain each part of the component for a user to understand when they are learning regex for the first time. This will help users understand how programmers usually would validate a user form. This will let users know basically the common and most used regex components in an regex expression.
